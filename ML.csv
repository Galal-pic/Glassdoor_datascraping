More about Homebot
Problem we're solving:
The US homeownership market is the largest asset class in the world at $30 trillion but is essentially an “unmanaged” asset that causes people to leave billions of dollars on the table every year. At the same time, loan officers and real estate agents spent $20 billion a year on desperate attempts to maintain mindshare and loyalty with their past clients in hopes of gaining more repeat and referral business.
Our solution:
Homebot is a client-for-life portal that maximizes repeat and referral business for lenders by empowering consumers to build wealth through homeownership. The award-winning client portal delivers personalized, actionable intelligence throughout the entire homeownership lifecycle to every client and prospect. With an average 50% monthly engagement rate, Homebot ensures lenders and agents remain the trusted advisors that consumers rely on to make informed decisions about the largest asset they may ever own, their home.
It's definitely a game-changer and we are truly making an impact. Having launched in 2016, we're over 100 Homebotters strong and expect to continue that growth throughout the year. Join us!

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

342,"Basis Postdoctoral Fellowship, Perception & Model Discovery","$100,000",3.7,Basis,"New York, NY","Industry
Wholesale",Retail & Wholesale,"About Basis
Basis Research Institute is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.
The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.
The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.
To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.
About the Vondrick research group
The Vondrick group studies computer vision and machine learning. By training machines to observe and interact with their surroundings, we aim to create robust and versatile models for perception. We often investigate visual models that capitalize on large amounts of unlabeled data and transfer across tasks and modalities. Other interests include scene dynamics, sound and language and beyond, interpretable models, and perception for robotics. Our group is part of the Visual Computing and Machine Learning ecosystem at Columbia.
About the Fellowship
This postdoctoral fellowship is a collaborative initiative between Basis Research Institute and Columbia University's Vondrick Lab. Supported in part by the NSF's AI Institute for Artificial and Natural Intelligence (ARNI), the fellowship centers on research at the junction of perception and model discovery. As a fellow, you will be a key contributor to our focused efforts to develop systems capable of autonomously discovering causal models by conducting experiments in the physical environment.
Research Focus
Our research aims to understand and automate the generation of scientific models. This initiative requires integrating several areas—probabilistic inference, active experimentation, and program synthesis—with initial efforts elaborated in our blog post. The ultimate objective is to create an AI system capable of understanding the operating rules of real phenomena through directed experiments, and to develop a comprehensive theory of the principles by which it operates.
The research environment is both structured and adaptable, with multiple avenues for scholarly contribution. As a postdoctoral fellow, your expertise can shape various aspects of the project. Examples include developing:
Inference methods that integrate perception and causal model discovery into a joint process.
Algorithms for learning neural representations of 3D scenes that capture both geometry and local/causal dynamics.
Algorithms for active control and experimental design with implementation in robotic actuators.
Participation in this fellowship will deepen your foundations in multiple domains of intelligence, including perception, representation, and reasoning, while also allowing for a balance of focused research, academic exploration, and software development.
Who We're Looking For
We’re looking for PhD-holding researchers with the following traits:

Hours: While we prioritize in-person collaboration for its benefits to creative work, there is a degree of flexibility in your working hours. Expect to be available during certain set times each week for meetings, and be prepared to attend multi-day Basis-wide in-person events.
Salary: $100,000 plus benefits
FAQs
How is this fellowship different from a Research Scientist position at Basis?
Differences
Duration: The fellowship is time-limited, usually spanning 1 to 2 years, unlike the Research Scientist roles which are permanent positions.
Academic Collaboration: Fellows will have co-mentorship from academic PIs.
Emphasis on Publication: Fellows are expected to publish their research, aligning more closely with traditional academic roles.
Similarities
Contributions to Core Technology: Like Research Scientists, fellows are expected to contribute code to Basis core technology. Basis will support Postdoctoral scientists without extensive software engineering experience to develop these skills.
Research Funds: Fellows will have access to an annual allocation of research funds ($5,000) to be used for research expenses, skill development, conference attendance, and more.
Integration with the Basis community: Fellows will participate in Basis events, on-sites, and other activities, and may collaborate on other Basis projects.

Position Description


Professor Daniele Venturi of the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) invites applications for two postdoctoral scholars.

We are particularly interested in candidates whose research brings together high-performance scientific computing, applied mathematics, and machine learning to craft new generations of methods for complex applications across data-science and engineering. Priority will be given to the following interdisciplinary research areas: physics-informed machine learning (neural operators, epistemic/stochastic neural nets, generative modeling), probabilistic graphical modeling, multi-fidelity and reduced-order modeling, data-driven modeling, and uncertainty quantification. Consideration will also be given to candidates working in related research areas.

The overarching goal of the research work is to set a new paradigm in how we account for, estimate, and propagate uncertainty in complex multi-scale physical systems by building a new deep learning framework for modeling, inference, and probabilistic estimation. The research aims at advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) at their interface with data assimilation and prognostics of physical assets, in what we refer to as Digital Twin Ecosystems (DTEs). DTEs will mature in the not-too-distant future. However, related technologies of computing, telecommunication, and sensing, as well as supporting algorithms and underlying science will advance significantly in the same time period. This perceived co-evolution drives our vision for a modular and hierarchical DT architecture guided by mathematical rigor and scientific utility, based on interoperability of algorithms and software components.

The postdoctoral scholars will be assigned the following responsibilities.
Publish research papers on topics relevant to Digital Twin Modeling and Scientific Machine Learning.
Attend weekly research meetings and provide frequent research updates.
Write quarterly research reports and presentations.
Present research advances at conferences, workshops, and program reviews.
Work with graduate students on research papers.

The department of Applied Mathematics is part of the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, and one of the very few applied mathematics departments housed in an engineering school nationwide. Established in 2018, the department offers a unique multidisciplinary and vibrant working environment, with rapidly growing PhD and masters programs in applied mathematics and scientific computing, and a new undergraduate major. Nestled in a beautiful redwood forest above the city of Santa Cruz, the department embraces groundbreaking interdisciplinary research across engineering, physical and mathematical sciences. Our proximity to Silicon Valley, and our satellite campus there, afford opportunities and avenues for collaboration with researchers working in the many research and development labs in Silicon Valley, as well as with the other San Francisco Bay Area universities.

Organization: Aquatic and Fishery Sciences
Title: Postdoctoral Scholar- Teleconnected: Identifying tele-connected distributions using machine learning
Position Details
Position Description
The College of the Environment fosters existing and new collaborations between outstanding faculty, staff and students who are engaged in the study of: the solar system and Earth’s dynamic land, water and atmosphere; the development and application of environmental engineering and technological advances; and the impact of policy and human actions on the environment, and the management of natural resources.

The School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences (SAFS) is dedicated to sustaining healthy marine and freshwater environments. Our school comprises one of the largest and most diverse academic aquatic and fisheries sciences programs in the United States. Our faculty conduct innovative research from the organism to the ecosystem scale, and are recognized leaders in aquatic biology, sustainable fisheries management, and aquatic resource conservation.

We are proud of the different roles that our students, staff, and faculty play in the community of the School and in the College of the Environment. We recognize that science is richer and the SAFS community is more vibrant when a diverse group of people participate in the SAFS community.

Tele-connected distributions are ubiquitous in ecology; events in one location impact events in other locations. This project will develop methods to identify tele-connected distributions with machine learning. These methods could be used in many circumstances, including migration outcomes, connections in weather patterns, pollution impacts, and fishery dynamics. The case study for this project will be modeling larval dynamics in the Bering Sea by predicting distributions of young fish based on distributions of spawning fish that have a pelagic larval phase. Tele-connected distributions will be identified as clusters of spawning biomass and recruitment in space based on biomass, proximity, and other environmental covariates using clustering algorithms. Machine learning algorithms will be used to model each recruitment cluster based on the variability of the clusters of spawning biomass. The method will be applied to data for at least five Alaskan stocks, including snow crab (a stock recently declared overfished) and yellowfin sole.

The anticipated start date is December 1, 2022, but this is negotiable. The appointment is for 1 year. Applications should be submitted by October 15, 2022, but the position will remain open until filled. This is a full-time position located at the University of Washington in Seattle.

As an employee of USC, you will be a part of a world-class research university and a member of the “Trojan Family,” which is comprised of the faculty, staff, and students that make the university a great place to work.
As a community of Dornsife College “we are committed to the creation, preservation, and communication of fundamental knowledge in all its forms…as well as a lifelong passion for learning and a commitment to the betterment of society.” The academic mission of Dornsife College can only be realized to its fullest potential when we build and protect a representative, equitable, inclusive culture of scholarship for students, faculty, and staff. This is not done through initiatives but by embedding these values into the everyday interactions, relationships, policies, and practices of the College. What is required is a seamless integration of the tenets of equity and inclusivity into every facet of academic life. If we want our scholars, staff, and students to be able to give their very best, we must create an academic environment that portends success.
Success is possible when every member of the Dornsife community owns their role as a steward of the culture in which we learn, research, and work; when we believe that it is because of who we are that we are able to do what we do: achieve excellence, together.
Achieving a robust and inclusive academic culture requires more than just the completion of a task, but includes that person’s capacity to contribute positively to the relationships and culture of their office or department. Therefore, any applicant seeking to advance the mission of Dornsife College should also be assessed on their capacities beyond the technical elements of their work, and demonstrate an understanding of their impact on others, and to articulate how they contribute positively to those around them.

In the first stages of the project, this work will mostly involve transcribing what officers and drivers say. In later phases of the project, we will ask for more subjective assessments of communication between officers and drivers. We will provide paid training for this role. The data that annotators record will be used to train a machine learning model, helping us measure key aspects of communication between officers and drivers.
Responsibilities:
Focused evaluation of substantial amounts of video and audio data for extended periods, up to 7 hours per day.
View video footage captured by police body cameras and record information about interactions.

599,High Content Image Analysis-Trainee,-1,-1,Axle Informatics,"Rockville, MD",-1,-1,"Overview:
The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) works towards transforming the translational process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster. Translation is the process of turning observations in the laboratory, clinic and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and the public.
NCATS research groups extensively utilize automated microscopy equipment and high-content analysis (HCA) methods for cell-based drug discovery campaigns. These technological approaches enable the high throughput testing of novel pharmaceutical compounds in mammalian cellular model systems. HCA approaches rely on computational algorithms to measure changes in cellular behavior that are recorded in digital micrograph images. Along with other orthogonal experimental approaches, the HCA projects push forward the primary institutional goal of NCATS, which is to increase the rapid translation of fundamental biological understanding into clinical therapies that directly benefit patients.

Internship Program at Axle Informatics/NCATS

The California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others.

With already established applications for voice control, sound classification, machinery monitoring, and distributed power grid monitoring, Aspinity's programmable analog processing technology is positioned to be the key abstraction layer for the physical world at a time when new user interface paradigms (touch to voice to …) and new monitoring capabilities are transforming industries. Join us as we build this new analogML framework!

More about Homebot
Problem we're solving:
The US homeownership market is the largest asset class in the world at $30 trillion but is essentially an “unmanaged” asset that causes people to leave billions of dollars on the table every year.

Our solution:
Homebot is a client-for-life portal that maximizes repeat and referral business for lenders by empowering consumers to build wealth through homeownership. The award-winning client portal delivers personalized, actionable intelligence throughout the entire homeownership lifecycle to every client and prospect. With an average 50% monthly engagement rate, Homebot ensures lenders and agents remain the trusted advisors that consumers rely on to make informed decisions about the largest asset they may ever own, their home.

--",--,"About Remedy Robotics
Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Much of this could be prevented with better access to specialist care. Take stroke as an example: any delay in treatment can lead to permanent disability or death. However, due to a lack of specialist surgeons, the most effective intervention can only be performed in 2% of US hospitals. For patients who present to one of the 98% of hospitals that do not offer the surgery, treatment is either significantly delayed or not offered at all because timely transfer is not feasible.
Our mission is to bring state-of-the-art vascular intervention to anyone, anytime, regardless of their location. Our team of medical clinicians, roboticists, and machine learning experts are working to bridge this gap by building the world’s first remotely-operated, semi-autonomous endovascular surgical robot.
We’ve already done what nobody else could—using our system, doctors from around the world were able to remotely perform this procedure from as far as 8000 miles away. We now need your help to bring this technology out of the laboratory and into hospitals everywhere.
The Role
We’re looking for someone to continue leveraging our vast trove of medical imaging data in order to train and deploy deep neural network models. These models enable our surgical robot to understand and reason about both our robot and the patient’s anatomy, which ultimately gives doctors the insight and control necessary to quickly and safely complete the procedure.

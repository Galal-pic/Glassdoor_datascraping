Recursion is a digital biology company industrializing drug discovery. We are working to solve some of the hardest, most meaningful problems facing human health today. Come join us in our mission to decode biology to radically improve lives, while doing the most impactful work of your life.
Recursion's Returnship Program
Our Returnship program is sponsored by the Women at Recursion Employee Resource Group. The program is aimed at helping those who have taken a hiatus (2+ years) from the STEM industry have the opportunity to return to the workforce in a learning environment with support from teams and mentors. This allows our company to tap into an underutilized pool of talent in Utah, and leverage the experience and skills of previous work and life experiences, while also providing opportunity to learn and develop experience in new cutting-edge tools and technology. This sixteen-week program will enable you to have ownership of projects that can deeply impact the company's mission to radically decode biology and serve patients, while having the guidance, support and mentorship as you re-enter the workforce. Each Returner will be assigned a mentor who will meet with them weekly, as well as weekly seminars on workplace culture, communication and technology.

Work with customers to understand user needs, and then build to address those needs.

We’re Via, and we build technology that changes the way the world moves. We pioneered the TransitTech category to ensure that the future of transportation is shared, dynamic public mobility — the kind that reduces carbon emissions across congested cities, minimizes reliance on private cars, and provides everyone with accessible, efficient, and affordable ways of getting around.
We created the first end-to-end TransitTech solution for cities and transit agencies, offering world-class software, service design, and operational expertise to fundamentally improve the way the world moves.
Via was founded with the guiding principle that we go further when we go together. We are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace.

Matroid's mission is to enable computers to visually understand the world.

With a “no programming required” product, Matroid brings computer vision into the hands of many. Our users can deploy cutting-edge, deep neural networks on the cloud or on-premise with the click of a button.
At Matroid, you will have the opportunity to work directly with founder and CEO, Reza Zadeh, and a world-class engineering team. You'll immediately take on high-impact projects, building features like visual search, semantic segmentation, custom object tracking, model interpretability, video summarization, and the infrastructure required to run complex machine learning workloads.
Headquartered in Palo Alto and founded in 2016 by Stanford Professor Reza Zadeh Ph.D., Matroid has raised $33.5 million from NEA, Energize Ventures, and Intel Capital.
We're looking for a talented full-stack JavaScript engineer to design and develop novel features for our computer vision platform. Creating a product in a new space requires creativity and technical acuity, and as part of the Matroid product team, you'll shape the functionality and feel of our platform, breaking new ground while working in an engineering culture that fosters employee empowerment. Over time, your role on the team will evolve with your growing interests and skill set.

You'll be working at our new office in downtown Palo Alto, just a five-minute walk from the Caltrain station.
What you'll be doing
Design and develop features for a computer vision platform that is truly the first of its kind.
Identify new technologies and best practices for our growing engineering team.
Improve site performance on both the client and server-side.
Incorporate user feedback to design and build a better product.
Create better visualizations for the outputs of computer vision models running on video streams and images.
Ensure that our platform features work at an ever-growing scale.
How you'll be doing it

You'll be part of a world-class, multidisciplinary engineering team, where each member identifies and prioritizes valuable and interesting new features to work on.
You will operate in a collaborative but highly autonomous environment that isn't bogged down by unnecessary meetings or project management.
You will know that almost everything you build affects real-world users, and you will set the quality standards for your work appropriately.
You will think creatively and your suggestions about new features and ideas will be considered by other members of the team.
You will have direct access to customers and be able to iterate on your features based on their feedback.
You'll be working with modern technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, Docker, and Kubernetes.
You will learn a lot along the way, diving into new technologies and the world of computer vision both on your own and during frequent company tech talks.
What you'll bring to the table

You have a strong handle on modern JavaScript development, even if you don't know every single JS quirk.
You are a self-starter who can prioritize what to work on and fully design, build, and write tests for new features.
You're comfortable moving across the stack: on a typical day, you might optimize a database query and tweak a user interface to be more intuitive.
You have an eye for design and an understanding of what can make a user interface more intuitive and delightful.
You can show that you're smart, analytical, and a fast learner. Sometimes you'll work on things using unfamiliar languages or technologies, but you know you can handle that.
There aren't any strict requirements for your background, but you're technical. Maybe you have a CS (or similar) degree, or you're a boot camp grad with a STEM background and strong portfolio, or you might be self-taught with a few years of industry experience.
It's a plus if you have experience in areas that might be relevant to a startup working on computer vision: data visualization, scaling web applications, DevOps, etc…
Willingness and eligibility for security clearance up to TS/SCI

Complete helps candidates, employees and teams navigate the opaqueness of compensation. We've done this by reimagining the offer letter experience (replacing those boring PDFs ), internal rewards tools, and the compensation planning platforms themselves.
We are looking for creative, thoughtful, and passionate team members to support us in our mission of making compensation more transparent.

Responsibilities
As Complete's founding engineer, you'll play a key role in delivering on our mission to bring transparency to startup compensation.

As a full-stack engineer, you will own the delivery of products end-to-end, from writing database migrations to building and styling React components.
Our excitement about our mission and our stage of company requires a commitment from every employee, equally establishing a high bar of autonomy and responsibility.
Complete HQ is in San Francisco, and we're looking to build out the team in SF.
You'll succeed in this role if you have the following qualities:
Autonomous and high agency - You have a track record of building products end-to-end in environments of high ambiguity. You're known as someone who owns problems and outcomes.
Customer obsessed - You will work directly with customers to build empathy, understand their needs, and provide support. We don't believe you can create a world-class product without deep customer empathy.
Leads with empathy - You're willing, able, and excited to help a fellow team member.

We have the following expectations:
You will build and ship high-quality products quickly.
You will build empathy for the customer and build features to solve their needs that we may never have expected or explicitly planned.
You will write up engineering proposals translated from designs or direct customer feedback. You'll be able to convert these proposals into well-scoped and prioritized tasks that you deliver on time.
You will help drive the technical roadmap forward by contributing to architectural decisions and building new infrastructure, services, and applications from zero-to-one.
You will push the quality and excellence bar by advocating for and practicing engineering best practices, including code reviews, testing, code quality, security, and monitoring.
You have a passion for your craft that drives you to improve systems and code without being explicitly told.
You are excited at the opportunity to grow with the company. We are very early, and you will need to level up quickly in both execution and leadership to grow with us.
Tech Stack
The frontend is a React application written in Typescript and hosted on Vercel.
The backend is a Django application written in Python and hosted on Render.

We use Linear, Notion, and Slack for async communication and project management.
Process
Our interview process is short and to the point. You'll talk with the founders from the first call, and we can wrap up the entire process in days, not weeks. Our mission is to bring transparency to compensation, which also applies to our candidate experience. We'll share compensation expectations up-front.

We're making the next generation of modern creator tools to enable everyone to share their story online. Join us at Kapwing on our mission to help marketing, communications, and media teams make more and better video content faster.

Everyone is a creator. The problem, however, is that today's tools get in the way of expressing our creativity fully. Especially when it comes to video, the gap between an idea and a video is wide enough that it's hard to even start.

Our mission at Kapwing is to empower digital storytellers and the creative teams they work within. Kapwing is a video creation hub that makes marketing and communications teams 10x faster in creating video content together. Millions of creators every month choose Kapwing to tell their story and bring their ideas to life.

Being in the browser allows us to turn video editing, a traditionally heavyweight, time consuming workflow, into a joyful, collaborative, and fully-featured experience. We believe that AI - generative AI and automations from the transcript - can make storytelling easier, more fun, and more distributed across an organization.

While software is the core of our product, being creative is the core of our work.

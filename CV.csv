A day in the life with the Intelligent Systems Group
Our projects lie at the interface between fundamental research and engineering, and we are often adapting ideas from disparate academic fields and finding ways to apply them in various real-world domains. We have several R&D projects running in parallel, and work focus shifts according to different project needs and deadlines. Each project is coordinated by one of our Principal Investigators (PI) who are responsible for supervising and delegating workloads between projects and it is common for scientists, engineers, and analysists to be involved in two to three projects simultaneously. You will start off working on individual tasks and filling in singular needs but over time be given responsibility for developing and maintaining larger pieces of projects and owning your own systems. We encourage our group members' growth and provide opportunities for taking on more responsibility, eventually leading projects and deciding the direction of future research.
Our projects leverage the following core disciplines:
Computer Vision, Image Processing, and Numerical Methods

Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analytics
State Estimation, Filtering, and Statistical Analysis
Data Acquisition, Synthesis, Wrangling, and Processing
Software Development and Sys Admin
Research, Proposal Writing, Grantsmanship, and Business Development
Even though you will start off focusing on one specific domain, team members are frequently involved on multiple projects with duties that span across these core disciplines. It is perfectly acceptable if find yourself slowly branching out or changing disciplines as your interests change and certain projects gain more traction than others. Branching out takes the form of joining existing projects or working on proposals to start new ones. Each of us is involved to some degree with the evaluation of government-released research solicitations. When batches of solicitations are released by various government entities, like NASA or the Department of Defense, for example, we come together as a team and decide on which ones we should pursue and who will lead efforts on writing proposals to the selected topics.

Interview Process
After applicants have submitted their application, our interviews follow a four-step process:
Pre-screening and request for work sample. If an applicant's resume passes pre-screening, Lynntech will send out a candidate packet which contains information about the company and the team. We will also request a work sample which is demonstrative of the applicant's experience relevant to the job posting. If the work sample demonstrates relevant proficiency in the job domain, Lynntech will continue with scheduling a time for an interview.
1st Interview (Usually Phone/Virtual unless local candidate). [Duration: 1 hr] During this call, both parties will review background information and review eligibility requirements. Company policies, job expectations, work environment, and availability will be discussed. The interview may conclude here if the candidate is no longer interested in pursuing the opportunity or if the candidate does not meet basic eligibility requirements. We will also discuss the different roles in the group and establish the domain specific project needs which we have at that moment and candidate will be asked to rank their experience and comfort level with the various core disciplines. Candidates will be expected to elaborate on their relevant past project experience.
Candidate Assessment, Part 1: If both parties choose to continue, candidates will be asked to complete and submit Part 1 of the Assessment which was included in their packets. This assessment covers fundamentals in computer literacy, programming, and mathematics. Lynntech will review the submission and before scheduling a second interview. Part 2 of the assessment is only requested if a second interview is scheduled.
2nd Interview (Usually On-site*) and Part 2 of Assessment. [Duration: 3 to 4 hr] If both parties choose to continue, an in-person interview will be scheduled, and the candidate is responsible for completing Part 2 of the assessment prior to the second interview. The candidate will be notified in advance if an optional domain specific assignment or live coding interview is required. This final step will be comprised of the following:
Past Project Presentation/Demo: The candidate will give a 10-15 minute presentation/demonstration of a past personal or professional project which relates to one of our core disciplines. Your presentation should resemble more of a story than an academic talk and it can be an example from your past personal or professional experience. If you have physical or virtual demonstrations at hand, or something interactive, you're encouraged to bring them. It's also beneficial if you have pictures/graphics and videos walking us through your development process and showing the final result. Highlight any problems or challenges you faced along the way and how you overcame them. There will be time at the end for Q&A and open discussion. If you're uncertain about what topic to present on, please reference our technical domains for guidance. Duration: 25 to 45 min
Project Domains and Core Disciplines Discussion: We will discuss what the existing project needs are and how the candidate's skill set can best fit the project needs. We will review the various roles, responsibilities, and how the various core disciplines relate to our projects. Duration: 30 to 40 min
[Optional] Assessment Review: If reviewers have previously provided a domain specific assignment, candidate answers will be reviewed, and additional questions may be given. Interviewers will assess candidate's ability to reason through challenges and their ability to identify and test their assumptions when approaching problems. Duration: 30 to 60 min
[Optional] Live Coding Interview: A live open-book set of coding problems. Candidates will be given programming problems which they must solve. Internet search will be available for looking up information and interviewers will be there to answer questions and help if necessary. This will test not only the candidate's ability to program, but also their ability to search for answers and ask for help and collaborate when appropriate. Duration: 30 to 60 min
For long-distance candidates, this may be a virtual interview. If a job offer is made the candidate will be invited to for an on-site visit before a final response is expected.

CLASS CHARACTERISTICS
Fiscal Technician I: This is the entry-level classification in the Fiscal Technician series. Initially under close supervision, incumbents learn and perform fiscal related duties. As experience is gained, assignments become more varied, complex, and difficult; close supervision and frequent review of work lessen as an incumbent demonstrates skill to perform the work independently. Positions at this level usually perform most of the duties required of the positions at the II-level, but are not expected to function at the same skill level and usually exercise less independent discretion and judgment in matters related to work procedures and methods. Work is usually supervised while in progress and fits an established structure or pattern. Exceptions or changes in procedures are explained in detail as they arise.
Fiscal Technician II: This is the fully qualified journey-level classification in the Fiscal Technician series responsible for performing the full range of paraprofessional accounting support duties in assigned areas which include, but are not limited to, accounts payable, accounts receivable, payroll, and cash handling. Positions at this level are expected to work independently, and exercise judgment and initiative within established guidelines. Positions at this level receive only occasional instruction or assistance as new or unusual situations arise and are fully aware of the operating procedures and policies of the work unit.
Positions in the Fiscal Technician class series are flexibly staffed and positions at the II-level are normally filled by advancement from the I-level; progression to the Fiscal Technician II level is dependent on (i) satisfactory work performance; (ii) the incumbent meeting the minimum qualifications for the classification; (iii) management affirmation that the position is performing the full range of duties assigned to the classification, and (iv) management approval for progression to the II level.

Subject Matter Expert – Biomedical Imaging and Medical Image Analysis Specialist,-1,3.4,Kikiktagruk Inupiat Corporation,"Bethesda, MD","Industry
Business Consulting",Management & Consulting,"Title: Subject Matter Expert - Biomedical Imaging and Medical Image Analysis Specialist
Location: Bethesda, MD
Status: Exempt - On-Site

Position Summary:
Chronic liver disease (from fatty infiltration or infections), with accompanying hepatic inflammation and subsequent fibrosis, affects over 4 million Americans and often progresses to cirrhosis and primary liver cancer with approximately 51,000 deaths per year in the US. Early assessment of inflammation is of the utmost importance for improved liver treatment and recovery. However, inflammation is difficult to diagnose and the progression of inflammation to fibrosis and cirrhosis in chronic liver diseases is a continuous process that requires invasive biopsy to quantify for appropriate medical management. Invasive biopsy provides subjective histopathologic ranked scoring systems that attempt to classify fibrosis and inflammation. Even though biopsy is considered to be the gold standard for quantifying liver fibrosis and inflammation, it suffers from sampling errors that may not reflects the true extent of pathology in addition to being an invasive technique that causes pain and potential complications to patients.
As the liver becomes fibrotic, nodules and abnormal spherical areas of cells form as dying liver cells are replaced by regenerating cells. This regeneration of cells causes the liver to become stiffer. Recent radiological advances allow bedside assessment of liver stiffness with various vibrator-assisted imaging techniques such as Fibroscan, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Yet none of these methods has been shown to accurately detect and clinically quantify the amount of inflammation. Furthermore, they neglect the potential effect of tissue inflammation on liver stiffness measurement accuracy.
The accurate non-invasive assessment of liver inflammation in addition to fibrosis assessment has become increasingly important as it allows for individualized early treatment management. The lack of accuracy and reproducibility, and challenges in assessment has been a major limitation for both clinical management and in liver disease research.
Liver damage can be prevented and, in many cases, reversed if liver disease is treated in its early stages in which inflammation precedes fibrosis. Biopsy, while the gold standard is also hardly justifiable in early stages. Biomedical and Metabolic Imaging Branch proposes a project to target this dilemma by offering to develop a safe, non-invasive, and affordable alternative to biopsy to assess liver inflammation and provide adjusted quantification of liver stiffness. Tens of millions of liver disease patients may benefit from these techniques either for early disease assessment and treatment or following up treatment effects, or in longitudinal clinical pharmacological studies in which the effect of new medication can be followed in patients without intervention.
In order to accomplish the goals of this project, The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), Biomedical and Metabolic Imaging Branch has a requirement to obtain services of a scientist with extensive expertise in biomedical imaging and medical image analysis with demonstrated understanding of, and ability to apply principles, concepts, practices and standards associated with biomedical imaging and medical image analysis. The scientist must demonstrate experience and understanding of techniques directly applicable to the Biomedical and Metabolic Imaging Branch research (medical imaging, image processing, machine learning, etc.) and must be self-motivated and driven to achieve milestones and exceed goals with minimal direction. Furthermore, they must possess a PhD with 20+ years of demonstrated expertise in biomedical imaging and medical image analysis research.
Duties/Responsibilities:
Develop and implement a 3D MRE technique and algorithms to analyze 3D MRE liver.
Develop and implement analysis algorithms optimized for liver tissue deformation imaging driven by inherent cardiac motion to measure liver tissue biomechanical properties.
Develop and implement machine learning algorithms to estimate the levels of inflammation and accordingly correct the fibrosis stage using liver tissue biomechanical properties.
Write well-designed, testable, efficient code.
Interpret, analyze and present data; work in fast-paced, result oriented research environment.
Contribute to project advancement by developing new methods or technologies and troubleshooting existing protocol.

Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.

We build robots that find other robots and knock them out of the sky. At a time when air superiority can no longer be taken for granted, the Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (CUAS) team provides mission critical capabilities to warfighters. From detection to tracking, identification, deterrence, and defeat, our family of networked sensors and effectors enables our customers to rapidly close the kill chain against a broad range of UAS threats. Working across product, engineering, sales, logistics, operations, and mission success, the CUAS team develops, tests, deploys, and sustains the Anduril CUAS Family of Systems (FoS) in challenging operational environments worldwide.

In your role as a Mission Operations Engineer on the CUAS team, you are responsible for delivering and sustaining a CUAS capability in Hazard Zones that meets our customers’ mission requirements and exceeds their expectations. You fulfill this responsibility through rigorous operational execution, detail orientation, proactive communication, deep mission understanding, and hard-won product expertise. You feel ownership over the health and performance of all assets and technologies deployed to your customers and users, and ensure that the system delivers when they need it most. You represent Anduril to our customers, building their confidence and trust through your professionalism and commitment to excellence. You also represent our customers back to Anduril, communicating user feedback and lessons learned to continuously improve our product and our team in response to evolving mission needs. Above all, you set the standard for what good looks like for your customer, and you rally your Anduril teammates to meet that standard every single day.
WHAT YOU'LL DO
Mission execution: Do whatever it takes to achieve mission success for Anduril and our customers. Meticulous, resourceful, and detailed-oriented, you will manage every step of the deployment process, from site survey to testing, pack-out, installation, training, and sustainment. No job is too small. You consistently demonstrate extraordinary judgement, grit, and composure in high pressure situations. You anticipate every contingency, build lightweight processes, soberly assess and mitigate risk, and deliberately learn from your experiences to continuously improve.
Relationship management: Build trust with customers, users, and Anduril teammates through effective communication, positive attitude, and follow-through. With careful listening and observation, you internalize our customers’ priorities and requirements. You develop plans that build their confidence in, and understanding of, our capability. With empathy and responsiveness, you quickly build rapport with users and provide high-quality training and support. Internally, you develop relationships across the organization to operate effectively. Whether in writing or in speech, you communicate honestly and directly. You are committed to giving and receiving feedback well. Your partners always know what you expect from them, and know exactly what to expect from you.
Mission expertise: Develop a deep knowledge of your customer’s mission requirements, including the nature of the threats they face, regulatory challenges, resource constraints, rules of engagement, and more. You will become a CUAS subject matter expert and the voice of the customer, capable of effectively communicating requirements and CONOPS to Anduril engineers so they can continue to enhance our CUAS capability to meet evolving mission needs. You are deeply motivated to shape the future of air defense.
Product expertise: Develop a thorough understanding of the capabilities and limitations of Anduril’s CUAS FoS. You are innately curious about the technology underpinning our capability, and are not satisfied with a superficial understanding of how and why it works. You are constantly educating yourself about the strengths and weaknesses of different sensor modalities, the challenges of sensor fusion, power and networking requirements, and more. You will become an opinionated power user who can reliably forecast how our capability will perform against a broad range of threat profiles, environmental conditions, and mission constraints.

CLASS CHARACTERISTICS
Public Safety Dispatcher I:
This is the entry-level classification in the Public Safety Dispatcher series. Initially under close supervision, incumbents learn and perform routine dispatching duties. As experience is gained, assignments become more varied, complex, and difficult; closer supervision and frequent review of work lessen as an incumbent demonstrates skill to perform the work independently. Positions at this level usually perform most of the duties required of the positions at the Public Safety Dispatcher II level but are not expected to function at the same skill level and usually exercise less independent discretion and judgment in matters related to work procedures and methods. Exceptions or changes in procedures are explained in detail as they arise.
Public Safety Dispatcher II:
This is the fully qualified journey-level classification in the Public Safety Dispatcher series. Positions at this level are distinguished from the Public Safety Dispatcher I by the performance of the full range of duties as assigned, working independently, and exercising judgment and initiative. Positions at this level receive only occasional instruction or assistance as new or unusual situations arise and are fully aware of the operating procedures and policies of the work unit. This classification is distinguished from the Public Safety Dispatch Supervisor in that the latter is the full supervisory-level classification in the series responsible for organizing, assigning, supervising, and reviewing the work of personnel. Positions in the Public Safety Dispatcher classification series are flexibly staffed; positions at the Public Safety Dispatcher II level are normally filled by advancement from the Public Safety Dispatcher I level; progression to the Public Safety Dispatcher II level is normally dependent on (i) management affirmation that the position is performing the full range of duties assigned to the classification; (ii) satisfactory work performance; (iii) the incumbent meeting the minimum qualifications for the classification including any licenses and certifications; and (iv) management approval for progression to the Public Safety Dispatcher II level.

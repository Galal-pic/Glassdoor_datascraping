Second, the Data Analyst will conduct analyses on firearm-related violence, suicide attempts, and unintentional injuries in youth.

Across these two projects, the Data Analyst will lead comprehensive statistical analyses in administrative claims data using the newly released Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System Analytic Files (TAF), which include inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, and pharmacy claims from across the US from 2016-2021 from the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

The Data Analyst will work collaboratively with a team of investigators, including health services researchers, clinicians, and biostatisticians, as needed.

We are looking for someone with training in biostatistics, epidemiology, economics, statistics, or a related field.

The Data Analyst may also be asked to assist in conducting literature reviews, developing grant proposals, and developing presentations and manuscripts for the dissemination of findings.
SKILLS/ABILITIES/COMPETENCIES REQUIRED:
The ideal candidate will have achieved strong performance in masters-level statistics courses, with demonstrated strong analytic ability (including at least some experience working in SAS, Stata, R, Python, or similar programming languages). This position requires attention to detail, especially in ensuring data quality and accuracy. The ability to work simultaneously on various tasks, to maintain attention to detail, and to effectively contribute to the project team are also essential.

About Pluto Health, Inc.
Our Why: We believe that every person has a chance to thrive.

About us: Pluto health (http://www.trypluto.com/) strives to coordinate care and increase access to needed resources for people by leveraging quick access to data and insights in minutes, and then bringing together care coordination activities. Our team brings together siloed medical data, evaluates it, and works to address gaps in care for patients. Pluto has access to most major EMRs, labs and health centers (about 90% of the U.S. market), alongside multiple social determinants of health data sets, and insurance information. What is unique about Pluto is that it applies automated processes on behalf of patients so recall is minimized—no need to remember names of doctors, health centers, or recall portal log-ins to get needed information, then, our team evaluates health opportunities and works to address health gaps. We empower to optimize care and access.
Operating ethos: We are one of the few companies linking siloed data across health sectors and bridging care.

Job Type: Full Time; In-Office - Henderson, NV

Disclaimers:
This is not a remote position.
We are interested in every qualified candidate who is eligible to work in the United States. However, we do not have the capacity to sponsor visas.

Schedule: Fairly flexible schedule; Monday through Friday

Salary: $70,000 - $90,000 / year

Job Description:
We're looking for a great, well-rounded .NET developer to add to our small (~16 person) but awesome development department. Specifically, we want to add someone to our team that is responsible for our internal ad bidding system and its algorithms that manage our portfolio of millions of online ads. They also own our internal task management and rule engine.

Who We Are
In 2007, two pretty sharp brothers decided to bootstrap a new business venture using their poker winnings to fund it. A week before inception, one brother got a fox red Labrador retriever puppy and named him Red. He quickly became the center of their universe and the name Red Dog Media was officially born.
Today, Red Dog Media focuses on internet marketing; specifically performance marketing, search engine marketing, landing page optimization, and conversion rate optimization. What started with four employees has grown to over 50 people over the past 16 years.

Culture + Core Values
Our core values are woven throughout our entire interview process in order to gauge whether a candidate is a good cultural fit. There are several initiatives that keep the core values at the forefront of our culture. A few examples are: being discussed in 6 month reviews; our employee appreciation program; and being an integrated part of our company’s operating system.

Our Core Values:
Be Curious - Having a high level of engagement; Digging into problems; Not being satisfied with good enough; Being open to new ideas; Not being a know-it-all.

Be a Problem Solver - This is what separates the doers from the dreamers. It’s about executing and getting the important stuff done. A problem solver prioritizes, organizes, and simplifies. They are detail-oriented to make sure it's done right.

Be a Championship Teammate - While a ""team player"" is collegial, a champion teammate is much more. They have the drive to succeed, work hard, come prepared, hold themselves accountable to high standards, elevate those around them, and are coachable.

Be Better Than Yesterday - Do you bring more skills to the table today than a year ago? How do you plan to be better a year from now? We work in a fast-paced competitive industry. If we stagnate, we’ll get left behind. This applies at the company and personal level. Growth and improvement need not be only in technical skill sets; personal growth can be even more valuable. We embrace positive change and stretch ourselves to grow both personally and professionally.

Questions for You:

Do you produce robust designs and clean code?
That's what we want! Desire and attitude count a lot here. The ideal candidate will always be striving for perfection while accepting that they'll never reach it.

Are you a great coder?
Attitude may be key, but you've got to have the coding chops to back it up. We're a small company - full stack development is the name of the game. We primarily code in C#, TypeScript/JavaScript, and T-SQL. We use ASP.NET MVC as well as other frameworks and design patterns as needed A proven track record in these and/or related technologies is critical.

Do you work well with others?
We want someone who's both humble enough to accept feedback and confident enough to push our team toward greatness.

Are you flexible?
Deadlines get tight. We don't have tons of hard deadlines, but it can happen. Can you set aside your perfectionism to ensure the product ships?

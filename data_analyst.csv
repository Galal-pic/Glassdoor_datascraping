Research and Data Associate,"$77,100",3.2,Center for Justice Innovation,"New York, NY","Industry
Civic & Social Services",Nonprofit & NGO,"THE ORGANIZATION
The Center for Justice Innovation (formerly the Center for Court Innovation) is a non-profit organization that works with communities and justice systems to advance equity, increase safety, and help individuals and communities thrive. The Center's goal is to identify and resolve as early as possible the challenges that bring people into the criminal and civil legal systems. It does this in a number of ways—by developing and running programs that reduce the need for incarceration and enhance economic opportunity, conducting original research to identify what works, and sharing what we learn from our programming and research with those seeking to transform the justice system around the world.
The Center is an 800-employee, $100 million nonprofit that accomplishes its vision through three pillars of work: creating and scaling operating programs to test new ideas and solve problems, performing original research to determine what works (and what doesn’t), and providing expert assistance and policy guidance to justice reformers around the world.

Operating Programs
The Center’s operating programs, including the award-winning Red Hook Community Justice Center and Midtown Community Court, test new ideas, solve difficult problems, and attempt to achieve systemic change within the justice system. Our projects include community-based violence prevention programs, alternatives to incarceration, reentry initiatives, and court-based initiatives that reduce the use of unnecessary incarceration and promote positive individual and family change. Through this programming, we have produced tangible results like safer streets, reduced incarceration, and improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.

Research
The Center's research teams are staffed with social scientists, data analysts, and lawyers who are academically-trained or have lived experience and who conduct research in the U.S. and globally on diverse criminal-legal system and justice issues. Their work includes evaluating programs and policies; conducting exploratory, community-based studies; and providing research translation and strategic planning for system actors. The Center has published studies on topics including court and jail reform, intimate partner violence, restorative justice, gun violence, reentry, sixth amendment rights, and progressive prosecution. The research teams strive to make their work meaningful and actionable to the communities they work with, policymakers, and practitioners.

Policy & Expert Assistance
The Center provides hands-on, planning and implementation assistance to a wide range of jurisdictions in areas of reform such as problem-solving courts (e.g., community courts, treatment courts, domestic violence courts), tribal justice, reducing incarceration and the use of fines/fees and reducing crime and violence. Our current expert assistance takes many forms, including help with analyzing data, strategic planning and consultation, policy guidance, and hosting site visits to its operating programs in the New York City area.

Cocoa Climate Sustainability Data Analyst,-1,-1,Mars,"Chicago, IL",-1,-1,"Job Description:
Cocoa Climate Sustainability Data Analyst
Mars has set science-based targets to reduce the company’s greenhouses gases (GHG) emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Cocoa is the largest category within the business and plays a major role in enabling Mars to achieve the net zero target. Mars Cocoa Enterprise (MCE) has been implementing several activities that contribute to this goal and has been working to integrate this fully in business processes. This needs to be accompanied by enhanced, transparent, and accessible greenhouse gases (GHG) data analytics.
The Cocoa Climate Sustainability Data Analyst will play a global role to support the Cocoa Climate Sustainability team in developing, deploying, and generating MCE performance data analytics across key topics and KPIs relevant to the climate agenda and to other impact areas. This work ensures the link between the delivery or our sustainability objectives and our visibility of the performance results, strengthening business decision-making, ensuring data and information is actionable for business leaders, and enabling lower-footprint innovation through improved systems and tools. This role is responsible for interpreting complex sustainability data to support improved decision-making processes that will enable the efficient contribution of MCE to Mars net zero target.
Role responsibilities include global sustainability data analysis and reporting, farm-level polygon analysis and integration into Mars systems, impact factor methodology development and carbon footprint tool support. The role requires technical knowledge in a range of sustainability areas, including geographic information system (GIS), life cycle assessment with a core focus on climate, as well as strong capabilities in quantitative data analysis and modeling and systems integration. The ideal candidate will be a data-driven, adaptable, critical thinker who can maintain collaborative cross-functional relationships with other Mars teams, with suppliers and consultants.
What are we looking for?
Degree in business, engineering, data science or a sustainability-related topic.
Minimum 3 years’ experience working in a quantitative data analysis field or discipline, with focus on environmental sustainability, life cycle assessment and GHG accounting.
Experience across data analysis software and systems (SimaPro, Excel, Power BI, Python, etc.).
Geographic information system (GIS) expertise.
Technical knowledge across sustainability topics including GHG accounting and life cycle assessment.
Working understanding of GHG accounting standards and practices.
Strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
Data storytelling skills.
Ability to work flexibly with global teams across different time zones.
Occasional travel may be required.
What will be your key responsibilities?
Data Analysis and Reporting
Lead the data analysis and scenario development for GHG accounting in MCE, adopting the full life cycle perspective that is needed in Scope 3 accounting and that is pertinent to MCE. Support tracking MCE climate-specific and other related sustainability performance to meet mainly internal and occasionally external reporting needs. This requires validating, collating and analyzing sustainability data across many continents to provide a comprehensive view of the MCE climate sustainability progress. This role is to engage with cross-functional stakeholders and will work to identify data gaps or issues to help work towards more streamlined and precise climate sustainability data management.
Farm-level Spatial Analysis
Lead farm-level spatial data analysis and integrate related outputs into Mars systems to reduce and report GHG emission reduction from achieving deforestation-free status, monitoring farm-level climate-smart practices and properly allocating emissions to cocoa. This requires, among others, ensuring polygon data received from our suppliers are complete and of high quality. This is to be in collaboration with other functions and with external service providers.
Impact Factor Development and Validation
Responsible for proposing new GHG impact factor methodologies and to help build a library of archetypes for supplier and origin-specific impact factor generation. These include generating impact factors specific to cocoa, considering different origins, agricultural practices, whilst considering carbon sinks and sources such as above and below ground carbon sequestration. This work entails drilling down on Life Cycle Assessment assumptions for cocoa in the World Food LCA Database and enhancing the data considering links between supply chain existing data and the overall impact factor estimates. This work is to be done in collaboration with Mars Inc. global sustainability team, and results are to be used for internal and external reporting.
Carbon Footprinting Tool Support
Support the development and use of a range of tools key for MCE’s ability to deliver on the climate goals over time, helping inform and shape choices and decisions, develop emissions scenarios and build on existing tools such as the Cool Farm Tool.
Making the links with other impact areas
This role will also leverage the existing and developing capabilities to deliver on climate targets to other impact areas, namely: land footprint, water stress and potentially also human rights targets.
What can you expect from Mars?
Work with over 130,000 diverse and talented Associates, all guided by the Five Principles.
Join a purpose driven company, where we’re striving to build the world we want tomorrow, today.
Best-in-class learning and development support from day one, including access to our in-house Mars University.

Research Associate/Data Analyst
Job Description Summary
Admin Non-Exempt
Job Description
The Research Associate/Data Analyst will primarily provide analytical support to the Director of the Youth, Media, and Wellbeing Research Lab (YMW) at the Wellesley Centers for Women (WCW), Wellesley College. Our research involves quantitative and qualitative studies of adolescent and young adult social media and televised media use, socioemotional health, physical health, peer and romantic relationships, digital citizenship, election attitudes, and civic engagement. We are committed to an intersectional identity approach, exploring questions of race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, class, etc. We use a variety of methods to collect data in schools and community organizations, as well as through online platforms. We collect surveys, conduct interviews and focus groups, and social media content data of adolescents and young adults. Since 2013, we have collected multiple waves of cross-sectional survey data from over 25 countries related to gender equity and election attitudes from over 5000 individuals. Our recent NIH grant about adolescent social technology use amassed 5 waves of survey data from over 1500 middle and high school students in the Northeast. Locally, we also evaluate a summer workshop each year with approximately 25 youth using pre-/post-surveys. Another line of research that our lab conducts is the role of pets in adolescent development and technology use, which is a collaboration with Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.
The Research Data Analyst works collaboratively with our Project Coordinator, YMW Research Lab members, and with a doctoral-level statistical consultant, under the general direction of the Director. This RA’s primary role will be as the lab’s Quantitative Data Manager, which will involve co-developing recruitment and data collection procedures; creating, launching, and pilot testing Qualtrics surveys; data management (e.g., cleaning, confidential storage and documentation of identifiable data); and mentoring Wellesley College students on a variety of data analysis projects. Our quantitative data analysis will involve cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys, the latter which will require careful matching of participants from wave to wave. Data analysis may include recoding of variables, conducting reliability and validity statistics of study measures, quantifying qualitative data, and visualizing findings for academic presentations. The Data Analyst will maintain a library of relevant measures for past, current, and future studies. For grant proposals and funder reporting, the Data Analyst will prepare and summarize preliminary findings for the specific topic, including charts and tables depicting key highlights/insights using SPSS, Excel, Tableau, or similar programs. For manuscripts, the Data Analyst will draft and revise the Methods and Results section as needed.
In addition to the data analysis, the Research Associate will also provide administrative, logistical, and technical support as needed. Depending on the prior experiences and expertise of the candidate, these tasks may include collaborating with the Project Coordinator, Communications, and Technology teams to assist with quantitative and qualitative data collection, generating study content for website, creating infographics for the lab and WCW social media accounts, copyediting/formatting of manuscripts into the journal style (e.g., APA, AMA), and/or assisting with Institutional Review Board applications. Opportunities to publish in peer-reviewed journals and present at local and national conferences are available. Because this is a liberal arts teaching/learning lab, the data analyst will also work with multiple Wellesley College student research assistants.
This position is a grant-funded, 60% (21.0 hours/week) position with full benefits. Desired schedule would be part-time 3-4 days a week to be negotiated between 9-6pm.

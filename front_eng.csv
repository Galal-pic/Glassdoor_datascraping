(Remote) Senior Front-End Engineer,"$161,475",4.8,Float.com,"New York, NY","Industry
Enterprise Software & Network Solutions",Information Technology,"Who We Are
Float is the world’s leading software for teams to plan their time. Launched in 2012, we’ve grown every year since, and remain proudly independent, self-funded and profitable. We’re a team of 46 working 100% remotely and you’ll be partnering with team members distributed across the world including Australia, Canada, Mexico and Taiwan. Hear what our team has to say by browsing our blog, or reading our Glassdoor reviews. Check out what our customers think of Float from our G2 reviews.
We’re on a scale up journey, and we’re seeking people who thrive in this stage, given the autonomy, and the opportunity, to do the best work of their career.
Why We’re Hiring For This Role
Our front-end team is responsible for our customer facing applications which are the primary method by which our customers get their value from Float. We support a web application, an iOS app, an Android app, and a desktop app (Electron), all of which share a considerable amount of code, and they are only getting bigger.
As our product continues to grow our customer base continues to grow with it. We are seeking a skilled engineer to help move things forward and also to provide the all important coverage and maintenance to ensure that we can continue to deliver the high quality experience that our customers have come to expect.
That’s where you come in.
You’ll join a smart, capable group of engineers specifically focused on the web application, ensuring that the primary vehicle to deliver value remains exactly that. You’ll be helping to push forward the state of the art in web-based resource management, allowing customers to make the most of their time and providing value far beyond our cost.
We have some ambitious goals as a company and in order to fulfill them, we have some equally ambitious goals for our web application. We’re keen to be able to support our customers as they become more successful and grow, and this ever-increasing growth is starting to challenge some of our older systems. We’re eager to re-imagine our front-end so that we are able to support customers that are multiples the size of our current larger customer.
In this role, you’ll be an integral member of the team, contributing regular impactful changes and improvements to an application used for significant intervals of time each day by over 4,000 customers.
Our Team Lead, Haakon, explains the important role you will play within our Interfaces team. Watch this video.
You’ll be working asynchronously with a bright, dedicated team from across the globe, with a strong focus on taking complex problems and creating solutions that feel simple and intuitive for our customers.
What You’ll Be Responsible For
You’ll join our web application team and after an initial familiarization process you’ll likely find yourself leading a product-focused project in an upcoming cycle – perhaps bringing to life our project reports with improved charts and visualizations, or adding delight to every interaction of our onboarding experience. You’ll be responsible for discussing the specification with the Product and Design stakeholders, understanding the problem to be solved and satisfying yourself that we are able to produce a deliverable satisfying any constraints - performance being a key one.
Over time, you’ll likely specialize in some particular area of our application based on the overall front-end architecture, being responsible for resolving any regressions or bugs within that area as well as being the point of contact for any customer-sourced queries or similar.
As you become more comfortable with the product as a whole, it would be expected that you become more involved in the wider-ranging discussions on the future direction of our front-end architecture, and in particular how we can ensure that our web application can evolve to support our ambitious scaling goals, whether that be by wholesale rewrites of certain areas or strategic incremental changes or even simply more process & guidelines around how to develop within this performance-critical area.
You will quickly become a core member of the team, responsible for customer visible aspects of our product, working with our User Experience team to understand how our customers work with our product and how they want to use it, so that we can help them to make the most of it.
What You’ll Need To Be Successful
We’re looking for a strong, seasoned engineer with at least six years experience in leading and shipping successful and demanding projects to a global audience, working as part of a small focused team to deliver objectives, being comfortable managing your time and communicating clearly with other members of the team.
You’ll be excited and eager to work on a sophisticated web application and solve data and presentation problems in a performant manner for our world-wide user-base. You’ll understand the commitment that requires but also the fascinating challenges it can present.
You’d be described by your colleagues as a React expert and are completely comfortable working in an application written with React combined with Redux and Reselect for the state management aspects.
You have a passion for usability and able to account for the needs and ergonomics of both the end users of our interfaces, and the developers that will build them.
With respect to styling, we favor a CSS-in-JS approach that does not rely heavily on utility classes—no Tailwind here!
We’re currently in the process of migrating our front-end codebase to TypeScript, so familiarity with that is crucial.
In addition, you should be familiar with Jest or Vitest for all things testing and should be comfortable operating in a monorepo environment.
Experience with the following would be a big plus:
Building Android and iOS apps with React Native
Implementing Design Systems as a means to bridge the gap between design and development and provide a consistent user experience
Accommodating accessibility standards and best-practices
Working with distributed systems & event-based architectures at scale
Finally, you should be very comfortable working asynchronously, since the nature of our Engineering team is that we are distributed around the world. We rely on clear, concise, and proactive written communication to ensure we all have clarity and that any problems are raised in good time so we have the necessary time to react. You will have the freedom to set your own schedule and the autonomy to do so - provided you continue to deliver and communicate, we’re very hands-off on how you structure your days.
Why Join Us
Pay for this role is US $161,475 (Level 3). Here’s a blog post with more information on how we determine our salaries.
We’re a global async remote company with a diverse team of people from all over the world who share a common belief in living our best work life. We believe deeply in the idea of transparency and share our Float Handbook publicly so potential new team members can see first hand our perks & benefits as well as our ways of working. If you feel like you can thrive at Float to do your best work, we would love to hear from you.

Note: Industry research shows that women and those in traditionally underrepresented groups generally don’t apply to jobs unless they check all the boxes for the role. If you feel strongly that you have what it takes for this role but don’t check 100% of the boxes—that’s okay—we encourage you to apply anyway and highlight what you can bring to the table.
Hiring Process For This Role
You’ll find a lot of useful information about our interview process and what it’s like to join our global team on the Float careers page. The hiring process for this role looks like this:
Initial First Meet: If your application is shortlisted, you will have a 15-minute meeting with our Talent team. This meeting gives us an opportunity to learn more about your experience and also allows you to ask any questions you have about the role. We run through questions like the following:
Why do you feel your work experience aligns with this role at Float specifically?
What do you enjoy most about your current role? What will you be happy to leave behind?
What are your career goals for the next 2-4 years?
Technical Exercise: If you move forward you will be invited to complete a technical exercise that allows us to learn more about your technical skills. This is done at your own pace but on average takes between 4-8 hours to complete. Candidates that complete the exercise and meet the technical skill requirements will move on to the co-worker interview.
Co-Worker Interview: You’ll meet with Haakon and Guido from our Dev team, for a 45-minute interview that will deep dive into your related skills and experience and run through you
Management Interview: We take a very collaborative approach to hiring, so you’ll meet with Colin, our Director of Engineering and Lars, our CTO, for a 30-minute interview.
Final Interview: As the final step in the process, you’ll meet with Glenn, Float’s CEO, for a 30-minute interview.
Our hiring process takes an average of 28 days from the first interview to a job offer (based on YTD 2023 data). Romina or Linda from our Talent team will be in touch each step of the way to ensure that you are well informed and aware of the next step in the process.
Unfortunately, due to the high volume of applications, we can only contact candidates who have been shortlisted for the role. If you do not hear from us within 14 days of submitting your application, we encourage you to apply for another role in the future."

About Hencove
Our creative marketing agency is looking for a strong, versatile Front-End Web Developer to help us build, manage, and maintain great websites. The kinds of sites that make other developers say, “Dang, I wish I did that.” Oh, and try not to judge us by our website. As they say, the cobbler’s kids have no shoes. Better yet, join us and make great sites for our clients and our agency, too.
Hencove is a B2B marketing agency working with companies at the intersection of healthcare, finance, and technology. Our clients are hungry to differentiate and grow, and we support them across the marketing stack. Our work as a full-service agency spans the many disciplines and aspects of marketing from strategy and ideation to planning and management to execution and measurement.

You’ll have the opportunity to leverage development skills and collaborate with a full team of creatives. The role will provide valuable insights and experience in every aspect of the process and will create plenty of professional development opportunities.
About You
The ideal candidate is a self-motivated web developer with the desire to contribute to all aspects of a growing web development practice. If you’re looking for a well-established, deep team, look elsewhere. If you’re an I-want-to-make-it-happen person, we want to hear from you.

In a cloud software world, who you are and what you have access to determines the risk associated with your accounts being compromised, Abnormal Security aims to build a comprehensive tool to understand the employees of our customers, and aid security professionals in assessing the risks and threats impacting their employee base. Help us build a new layer of protection that will give enterprises the same level of security for their cloud offerings as Abnormal Security's industry leading products do in the email security space.

We're looking to add a Backend Engineer to our team of world class engineers. The individual in this role will shape and elevate our Notable Events team while working closely within the Behavioral Security Products division. This role straddles the line of velocity and excellence.

As a Backend Engineer of the Notable Events team, you will:
Build and maintain high-throughput, low-latency systems that process 100s of millions of events per day to enable detection to identify notable events
Enhance our frameworks for improving detection efficiency and effectiveness
Provide operational support to maintain a high level of system uptime and performance
Create a magical work environment with colleagues and memorable interview process for candidates

You are someone who wants to make an impact. You are passionate about solving customer problems and have built up a base of skills in backend and distributed systems development to do so. You want to apply those skills on a problem that leaves the world in a better place.

We are a scrappy team: we are building a new product from scratch - this means you should be comfortable with a level of uncertainty beyond what you'd find at a more mature company or even a more mature team at Abnormal. Not every project will come with a well defined PRD - that's expected and we expect this engineer to go dig in and figure out what to do. This also means occasionally we'll ask you to do things that may not strictly fit the role of a ""backend engineer"" - it might mean jumping on a customer call, or digging in to help fix a frontend bug.

We are also not only a remote team, but a very distributed team, as such you will need to have excellent communication skills across both verbal and written mediums. You will need to be just as comfortable on a zoom call as writing a 1 pager project proposal to be shared across the team for technical feedback.

In this job, you will bring these skills

Skills/Experience - Required:
Experience working with building and operating distributed systems and services
3-5 Years of overall software engineering experience
Experience with Python

Skills - Nice to have:
2+ years Golang

Tech Stack:
Language: Python, Golang
Platform: AWS
Framework: Django, Spark
Storage / Data Pipelines: Postgres, Redis, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Parquet

Role Responsibilities
Build and maintain high-throughput, low-latency systems that process 100s of millions of events per day to enable detection to identify notable events
Enhance our frameworks for improving detection efficiency and effectiveness

Software Development",Information Technology,"Product Designer
Do you get a kick out of turning complex problems into elegant user experiences? Are you interested in joining a team where you'll have wide latitude to impact the look and feel of the product? Do you want to work on a collaborative team where your ideas will matter, both internally and for customers?
Who we are:
Rockerbox is a leader in the SaaS marketing measurement field, addressing the evolving industry landscape and the emerging need for a new approach, known as ""measurement 2.0"". Significant industry changes over the past four years, including new privacy regulations, the deprecation of third-party cookies, and a shift in marketing spend towards harder-to-track channels such as TV, Direct Mail, and Connected TV (CTV) have rendered marketing measurement both more complex and more critical than ever.
Rockerbox addresses these challenges with a unique suite of product lines that centralize data and offer diversified measurement methodologies to marketers. The foundation of Rockerbox's solution is data centralization. Atop this foundation, the platform enables marketers to choose from a range of measurement methodologies, giving customers the flexibility to choose the most appropriate approach for their specific needs and questions.
Rockerbox is a values-driven company and people who enjoy working with us are committed to doing good work but not afraid to laugh at themselves. As a team, we are collaborative, transparent, and not afraid to admit when we're wrong — we move quickly, but we are not frantic. People who enjoy working on the Product team at Rockerbox are deeply passionate about delivering a well-constructed, valuable product to customers, curious, and eager to solve problems.
What you'd be doing:
As a Product Designer, you will be driving design research, ideation, and execution on both product enhancements and greenfield features. Your understanding of digital product design principles and insights from user research will inform the development of the product — you will drive the enhancement of the interface, making it better and easier to use. Starting from wireframes and prototypes to polished visual designs, you will help the team release product experiences that delight and empower our customers.
Some of the functions you'll take on include:
Work with product, engineering, and customer success to understand how our customers use Rockerbox and what they need to succeed
Analyze user behaviors and identify pain points and areas of improvement
Produce concepts and prototypes, in both low and high fidelity, to test and validate ideas
Collaborate with engineering teams to drive deliverables to implementation
Communicate your design work and the reasonings for your design decisions across the company
Help develop and evolve the Rockerbox design system
Who you are:
You deeply care about creating intuitive interfaces and appreciate the challenge of doing so for enterprise customers seeking to understand complex data. You communicate transparently, and enjoy collaborating with others. You create a balance between designing a beautiful UI and making robust functionality available to users. You enjoy thinking through complex problems and iterating through your ideas alongside your colleagues.
People from a variety of backgrounds could excel in this role, and our ideal candidate will bring:
4+ years experience as a Product Designer
Prior experience designing B2B software product with a complex, data-rich back end
Experience designing analytics products or data visualizations
Demonstrated success leading a design process from research to ideation to prototyping and iteration to collaboration with engineering to release
Experience with design and prototyping tools like Figma, Sketch, InVision
Why you'd love us:
If you are looking for a low-ego tech startup where you can learn a complex system end-to-end, and join the company as we are accelerating to scale, Rockerbox is the place for you. You'll have an early, instrumental role as we revamp the look and layout of the product, and your work will help set the foundation for future designers.
We're not your typical analytics company — Rockerbox uses data to give people actionable insights that they use to make budget decisions every day. You'll support innovative, customer-centric brands as they take on established players by giving them the tools they need to win. We use data to tell stories about who a company's customers are and why some marketing is better than others.
Not least, you'll work alongside colleagues who support each other to continually improve and deliver exceptional value, in a collegial, helpful environment — we genuinely like each other as people, and work together to make good things happen for all of us.
What you can expect when you get here:
We ship solid product quickly: We set the bar high and move fast. Our team is dedicated to excellence and efficiency, ensuring we meet aggressive timelines while maintaining quality, and iterating as we go.
Collaboration and support: While we push for quick progress, we do so as a united team. Our environment fosters collaboration, support, and mutual respect, making our fast-paced journey enjoyable and fulfilling.
A balance of urgency and camaraderie: Even during high-pressure times, we maintain a sense of community. This looks like sharing cooking photos, pets in costumes, travel tips and other fun things while maintaining attention on mission-critical work and deadlines.
Encouragement for builders: If you're eager to build and accelerate growth, you'll find your place here. We appreciate those who are hungry to make an impact and move quickly.
Flexibility and commitment: While we value hard work and dedication, we also recognize the importance of personal time and protect it, especially outside critical periods. Our team enjoys the flexibility to manage personal responsibilities and downtime, while simultaneously driving a dynamic, results-oriented environment.

Computer Hardware Development",Information Technology,"The opportunity:
Are you looking to accelerate your career growth by joining an early-stage company going after a massive market opportunity?
Visor is a fast-growing company simplifying how people work together. Our vision is to become everyone's favorite place to collaborate on data from anywhere. Visor's product looks like a spreadsheet so everyone knows how to use it. But it's the world's most deeply connected spreadsheet, making entirely new solutions possible.
The company was founded at Harvard. We're backed by the same investors as Airbnb, Shopify, Zapier, Hubspot, and Warby Parker. We have thousands of users worldwide.
We have raised funding (both announced and unannounced) and have plenty of runway. We don't have plans to fundraise for 2+ years.
The role:
We are looking for an experienced software engineer who loves building products. You will become the primary owner of our product engineering. As part of the founding team, you will work alongside the CEO and collaborate daily with the product and design teams. You will be asked to think and act like a founder, and you will be treated as an owner.
Within the first month, you'll start shipping production-quality code. By month three, you will be adding new logging and infrastructure reporting systems. By month six, you'll be adding new features. And by month nine, you'll be spearheading architectural decisions on new integrations.
Given the complexity of building a spreadsheet that works flawlessly with live-syncing external data, we have to keep the foundation rock solid. You will be a foundational part of our long-term strategizing and expected to plan our architecture three chess moves ahead of where we are today.
Who you are:
You have a Bachelors in Computer Science (preferred) or other relevant credentials that demonstrate deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and programming patterns
You're an seasoned engineer who has 5+ years of experience building backend architecture using Python and Django
You have advanced expertise with AWS ElasticBeanstalk, Django, PostgreSQL, Celery, and Redis
You have Javascript experience and a deep command of the contemporary Python language — more knowledgeable than most
A self-motivated learner who loves improving your skills and knowledge
A collaborative engineer who prioritizes the total output of the whole team over personal achievement
You're willing to recommend improvements to the company's existing practices but open to accept and embrace the architectural decisions and technologies already used
You're deeply interested in product quality, performance, and reliability (not just building new things)
Detail-oriented. To prove it, please include a sentence in your cover letter referencing this line and include this word: meticulous.
What you'll be doing:
Design and build back-end architecture for the core platform (Python, Django)
Gradually assume some engineering leadership responsibilities, including priority-setting, leading our process, and making major architecture and technology decisions
Collaborate with our Principal engineer to design robust, scalable APIs, systems, and architecture
Identify and resolve QA issues across the product
Own and advocate for the health and quality of the systems the team builds
Document your work and our architecture for improved collaboration
Salary range:
We believe in providing transparency into our pay plans to help eliminate the salary gap. The following describes our expected compensation range for this position. In these annual figures, we include the value of the employee's regular salary and discretionary bonuses. We do not include other parts of the company's compensation package, including: equity & options, benefits such as healthcare, unlimited PTO, and budgets for travel & equipment.
Please note that we may be able to extend offers outside of this range in order to match a wider range of candidate experiences and skills. If you are more experienced and have salary expectations higher than this range, please reach out to see if we should continue the conversation.

Please note that discretionary bonuses are subject to the terms and conditions of any bonus plan in effect at that time.

Past retreat locations have included East Hampton, the Poconos, and skiing upstate.

Eligibility:
At this time, we are only able to hire individuals who can work lawfully in the United States and will work from within the country.

About CLB Network
CLB Network helps Luxury Custom Home Builders dominate their markets, and an important part of that is their website.

We are focused on real, long term impact, not just quick disconnected projects. We’re a remote-first company, though most of us are centralized around Naples, Florida.

Requirements - PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, GIT
Ideal person can confidently approach building Statamic addons that make use various external APIs and can get at least a front-end framework built to hand off to someone with more of an “eye” for design, if necessary.

…are eager to make great websites.. but knows the ultimate goal is a bigger-picture 5-star experience for our clients.

How to apply

We welcome everyone — and we mean everyone. We believe a diversity of viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds only serve to make our team stronger, which is why we strongly encourage those from historically and systemically marginalized communities to apply: BIPOC, women, and people in the LGBTQIA+ community, to name a few.

As the editor of the team that covers local cities and businesses, your priority will be guiding reporters to deliver aggressive accountability journalism and stories that draw readers by highlighting developments in their communities that have an impact on their lives.
There are plenty of stories, the challenge is choosing which to tackle. Your job as editor is to make the decisions smarter, the copy sharper, the audience bigger and the reporters better.
You must be adept at helping reporters focus their energies on stories that make a difference and topics that matter to readers. How do the actions of lawmakers actually affect neighbors? What is behind the push for certain regulations? Why would someone living here care about this story?
This editor must be able to meet the challenge of covering policy in a way that is interesting and relevant for our audience. Framing stories with our audience in mind is critical, as is keeping a close eye on metrics to see what coverage resonates and which stories don’t, and using that information to make smart decisions.
Finding and building a digital audience by tapping into the themes and issues that directly affect people in South Florida, expanding the Herald's reach to undercovered neighborhoods and being fearless in experimenting with various storytelling initiatives are all important elements for success.

You need a passion for accountability journalism while being the gatekeeper for tone, balance and fairness. You need to collaborate with your reporters to produce their best work and be part of a newsroom editing culture that collectively aims for a high bar every day.
You will:
Work with reporters to brainstorm the best approaches to daily news and enterprise coverage of their beats.
Emphasize enterprise and accountability journalism, both short term and long term.
Be ruthless about cutting down on “should-do” stories that don’t have an audience and instead focus the team on pursuing “must-read” stories.
Steer your team clear of process stories, focusing on those that make a difference and matter to readers.
Edit to make good stories better and excellent stories exceptional.
Write active, engaging headlines to attract the best audience for each story.
Give clear direction to reporters on the front end and constructive, professional feedback on the back end.
Collaborate with newsroom colleagues to include the visuals team as early as possible so that videos and photos enhance the stories your reporters tell.
Use the most current best practices for social media and audience engagement.
Be committed to reflecting the diversity of our community in coverage.
Qualifications
Five years of daily news reporting and/or editing with at least some of that time covering/editing local government and political topics.

An understanding of digital publishing, online metrics and reader engagement.

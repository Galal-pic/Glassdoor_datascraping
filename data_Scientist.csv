We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
About The Role:
Notion’s mission is to make toolmaking ubiquitous. We are rapidly growing our business to empower every individual to build their own tools, block by block. The Growth Data Science team aims at accelerating product growth at every step of the user journey to ensure you get the best value out of Notion. This role will work closely with the Template and Creator Community team to accelerate template creator growth and user adoption of templates by improving Notion template gallery.
As an early member of the growth data science team, you'll be instrumental in setting the roadmap for how these teams work together and then doing the hands-on work to execute against it. There will be significant variation from one day to the next, but whether you're exploring where we see the biggest opportunity to improve user experience, what a successful Notion account looks like, building out a core activity data set, or running experiments to evaluate the success of a key feature launch, you'll absolutely impact the development of Notion.
What You'll Achieve:
You will apply your expertise in statistical inference, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with Notion
You will dive into ambiguous areas, define problems and opportunities for the team to work on the next influential project
You'll design the right set of experiments or analyses to evaluate the success of new features
You'll partner closely with a product, engineering, and marketing pillar at every step of the development process, driving forward data science and analytics work in that area.
You'll work with your teams to determine both north star and operational metrics, and build and maintain the dashboards that those teams rely on for monitoring progress and making key decisions.
You'll influence your product roadmap by communicating your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our product and business. (Insights are useful. Impact is even better!)
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
Ideally you have experience working on ranking, two-sided marketplaces, or creator monetization in previous roles
You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with product, engineering and ideally with growth teams. You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate to your partner teams what that impact is.
You have expertise in SQL and at least one scripting language (ideally Python or R).
You know how to use statistical inference and experimentation to drive actionable recommendations.
You have experience building predictive models, and you know how to evaluate their effectiveness.
You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the measure you need doesn't exist yet.
We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

Computer Hardware Development",Information Technology,"** Locations include Spring, Texas (preferred location), and US remote.
** Typically need at least Master's degree and minimum 0-2 years full-time relevant work experience.
The Team
We are a growing centralized team helping HP take advantage of new AI/ML technology, especially around Generative AI and large language models. We engage with business units to advise and prototype solutions, and we develop and run software applications for internal use.
The Role
As a Data Scientist with a focus on Generative AI you will work on multiple engagements across HP involving large language models and other new Generative AI capabilities. Beyond our team, you will work with business stakeholders and developers from other business units. Your primary focus and mindset is to help deliver business solutions to our (mostly internal) customers. You are expected to stay up to date on important new Gen AI papers and releases, but note that this is not an AI research role.
Skills and Profile
Knowledge of data science and machine learning core skills.
Experience with NLP, Large Language Models, LLM prompt engineering, vector databases, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and search engines.
Good computer science skills. Experience in a software development team is a big plus, especially with business applications in a cloud environment.
Tools you may use include Azure services such as Azure Machine Learning and Azure prompt flow, as well as python, langchain, streamlit, docker, git, and elastic search.
Some experience from a large complex organization is a plus.
Ability to participate in meetings with a multitude of stakeholders and communicate in a crisp manner. Mastery in English is required.
You enjoy explaining technical concepts (such as LLM's) to a non-technical audience.
You propose pragmatic solutions that are as simple as possible, which sometimes mean that no Gen AI component is necessary.
Interest in working in a distributed team with diverse backgrounds.
The recent AI progress is disruptive, and our team is in the midst of it. As a consequence, day-to-day priorities, tasks, and team structure may change rapidly. We are looking for somebody who thrives in such an environment. The role is not a fit if you value ""business as usual"".
Education and Length of Experience
For this position, we prefer at least a relevant Master's degree (e.g. Computer Science) or demonstrated competence, and a minimum of 0-2 years experience.

Summary:
The rapid evolution of technology offers exciting opportunities for individuals seeking challenging and meaningful careers. Conversely, it’s no secret that careers in this field are sometimes associated with isolation, silos, and the risk of hitting dead ends.
At JH Kelly, we approach technology differently.

As such, we challenge our teams to diversify their skill sets and follow their passions, firmly believing that people who are doing what they are genuinely interested in are more innovative than those toiling away in obscurity on one small part of a larger project.
At the core of our data strategy is our ERP, Vista by Viewpoint. We utilize SQL, SSIS, SSAS, and Tabular Editor to extract data from Vista and our propriety Project Control System to create the core of our Data Warehouse. From that, we leverage Power BI not only to create a traditional look-back reporting but to aggregate our data “over time” and project the future outcome of our Construction Projects. Our vision is to combine information from our Safety, Estimating, Design, and Supply Chain platforms with this data, in a Data Lake, providing end-to-end visibility on all primary processes within our Construction Operations.

Data Scientist,-1,-1,Milu Health,United States,-1,-1,"WE MAKE HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE FOR AMERICANS
Today, 112 million Americans have trouble paying for healthcare. Nearly 1 in 4 Americans have medical debt. Healthcare costs are skyrocketing, and patients are facing more of that financial burden. We started Milu Health to tackle this problem.


WHO WE ARE
Milu Health is an early stage startup focused on making healthcare affordable for Americans.

Using healthcare pricing data - a 500TB healthcare cost dataset that payers recently have had to release publicly for the first time ever - combined with other healthcare quality and claims data, we think we can change how employers and employees pay for healthcare and ultimately make high-quality medical care more affordable for patients.

Our tools comprise an operating system to reduce a patient's personal healthcare spend - from helping patients identify which high-quality and high-value doctors to go to for a procedure, to informing them about the most affordable prescription options for their medicines, to making sure their medical bills are correct. Through our entire stack, we engage patients through our consumer-facing products and cash-back incentives that can cover their out-of-pocket spend.

We're looking for the best people in the world to dig and build something great with us. It's not going to be easy. There's going to be twists and turns, successes and failures, and tons of learning. But we're in this for the long haul and believe we can fundamentally change a broken system.

Our founding team has spent the last combined 10 years building data-based healthcare businesses. Milu is backed by leading investors including a16z, Box Group, Steve Pagliuca, 81 Collection, Starting Line VC, Hypothesis Ventures and others.

THE ROLE
We're looking for a Data Scientist to join our team in our New York City or Evanston offices, or work remotely. As that data scientist, you will be responsible for the design and development of modules, pipelines and algorithms across all of our products, ultimately aimed at identifying cost savings opportunities and high quality medical options for patients. You will drive the scaleable analysis of data in a HIPAA-compliant environment. Ideally, you've previously done extensive healthcare claims data analysis and have experience working with CPT codes and other healthcare cost data. Most importantly, you're going to be an early data scientist on a growing team. You'll set our processes, culture and build the core infrastructure in the earliest days of the company. It's going to be a fun ride.

WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU

5-10 years of data science / data analysis experience, 3-5 years in healthcare
You've worked in agile environments and are comfortable iterating quickly
You're excited to work at a startup: things will change fast, we'll learn quickly, build, iterate and evolve"

Data Scientist (Multiple Levels),-1,-1,Red Alpha LLC,United States,-1,-1,"Description:

A little about us:
The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems.
Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed.
Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you.
A day in the life:
You’ll likely start your day at a customer location near our Red Alpha offices, checking to see if there are any important items that have just come up. If not, you’ll move on to improving a dashboard or other data product that you’re responsible for, or perhaps produce a weekly output the customer is expecting. You’ll be using R or Python a lot, but also Git, Mongo, some commercial software and several other usual suspects. Once a week you’ll attend a team meeting (with 4 others) to prioritize things, and you’ll have a lot of interaction with the team otherwise, typically several times per day. You’ll need your sense of humor and need to be willing to leave your ego at the door.
Requirements:

What you bring to the table:
Now on to the fun of formal requirements - we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in.
All of our data scientists need the following skills:
Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python
Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list.
A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field.
For entry-level data scientists, 0-3 years of experience on Data Science projects.
For mid-level data scientists, 3-6 years of experience on Data Science projects.
For senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams.
A TS/SCI with Polygraph security clearance.
These are important skills to have, but not necessarily mandatory:
Exceptional interpersonal skills. You know, as in you might not be at the top of the list to be a game show host but you do like people and enjoy solving problems jointly with your colleagues.
Experience with Java, C, or other compiled languages
Comprehensive knowledge of Saturday Night Live sketches (just kidding)
Experience with SQL/NoSQL, Spark, Hadoop
Familiarity with Javascript and Scripting
Familiarity with Docker, GitLab, and React
Why Red Alpha?
Every day, our elite customers are pushing through ""the grind"" to defeat the enemy, even putting their lives on the line for our freedom. Rise to the occasion with us to deliver engineering excellence, to match their dedication to this nation. Join us as we bring digital transformation to the fight.
Some of our perks and benefits:
You can retire sooner rather than planned: Get closer to retirement with up to 12% in 401k contributions.
You can have a career AND a life: Enjoy up to 5 weeks of leave (25 days of personal time off) and 11 paid holidays (all of which we treat as floaters).

About Abett and the Lockbox
Abett envisions a world in which everyone has access to high quality, affordable, and timely healthcare. Our mission is to deliver solutions to our clients that produce transparency and accountability. Those solutions put power into the hands of healthcare consumers.
The flow of healthcare data is complex and messy. Employers are the key consumer of healthcare in the US, but historically, they could not leverage their benefits plan data effectively. The Abett Lockbox empowers employers to take control of their data and achieve better outcomes, lower costs, and improved workflows for their benefits staff and plan members.
Our Problem
Why are we hiring a Sr. Data Scientist?
Abett’s clients are large, US-based employers. They use Abett’s signature product, the Lockbox, to aggregate and manage a broad array of benefits plan data.

Clients have demanded analytic insights and analyses as a part of our product portfolio. Their objective is to improve their understanding of the health of their members, the drivers of their healthcare costs, and the value of their benefits.
In light of our expanding analytic offerings, Abett is building out our Health Economics and Outcomes Research team to support healthcare analytics and program evaluations.
We are hiring a Sr. Data Scientist to support analytic offerings to help our clients understand their data, and to make informed decisions about their benefit offerings moving forward.
Role Summary
This role’s objectives are to develop statistical analysis plans and execute research to meet our client’s requests. We anticipate this will require consequential expertise working with claims data and coding in R.
Requirements:
Duties and Responsibilities
Engage with clients and prospective clients to understand their analytical needs and translate those needs into formal analytic plans. Generally, these audiences consist of benefits and finance staff at Fortune 500 enterprises.
Engage with Abett’s data engineering, information security, and software development teams, to execute analyses using coding best practices in R.
Develop statistical analysis plans to meet client’s needs.
Engage with clients to ensure analytic insights are meaningful.
Qualifications and Skills
Masters degree in statistics, economics, or related quantitative field.
Demonstrable expertise in working with healthcare claims data in R with 3+ years of claims-based analytic role history.
Expertise in developing statistical analysis plans.
Expertise in statistical methods including causal inference and machine learning.

Excellent verbal and written communication skills.
Why Abett?
Opportunity to join a high-growth, venture backed software company, with a clear and important mission.
Competitive market salary and equity options.
Flexible hours/scheduling. Work remotely. Fully paid Health, dental and vision benefits available. Unlimited PTO.
Abett is committed to equity and inclusion as an Equal Opportunity Employer.

“In 2012, a lawyer, a data scientist, and a software developer walked into a startup event…”
Yes, our beginnings read like the start of a joke. But in bridging the gap between the legal industry and the technology worlds, we built a suite of tools unlike any other on the market.

Here at Juristat, we continue to work towards that bold vision for the future of the legal industry. With each new product iteration, we’re one step closer to realizing our mission – to bring more transparency, predictability, and equity to patent prosecution.
We’re obsessed with improvement – in our products, our processes, and ourselves.
As an organization, we thrive in small teams that allow us to be fast and flexible and avoid the bureaucracy that slows growth. We are driven by opportunity and our passion for creating change.

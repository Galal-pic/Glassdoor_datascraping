"Senior Android Engineer, UI Systems",-1,-1,Afterpay,Remote,-1,-1,"Company Description
Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.
Job Description
UI Systems is building Square’s universal design system. This design system is deployed across all of Square’s seller-facing products on iOS, Android and web. This includes our flagship products Point of Sale, Square Register, and Square Terminal. Put simply, this team is building the public face of Square.
We’re not only building a design system, though: our mandate is wider than that. UI Systems is also building the core UI frameworks and tools needed to make building, testing, and maintaining UI easy and fast at scale: we’re supporting over 200 mobile engineers (and growing!) with our work across Android and iOS.
Why are we doing this? As Square grows, ensuring a consistent experience across many products becomes a larger and larger challenge. At Square, we value great and consistent design – UI Systems is here to ensure that Square’s customers and Square engineers alike have a delightful and consistent experience when working with, or working on our products – no matter who built them.
On iOS, our design system is built with Blueprint, our open source declarative UI framework. On Android, we’re building the design system from the ground up with Compose – this is Square’s first wide-scale deployment of Compose, and one of the first large-scale deployments of Compose anywhere outside of Google itself.
You Will:
As an engineer on the UI Systems team, you’ll be expected to partner closely with our design peers to inform and deliver components and tools that help our product engineers work faster, while ensuring a higher quality experience for Square’s sellers. You’ll also function as a translator of sorts – identifying needs and missing pieces from engineering and bringing them to the team to push the entire system forward. We also work closely with peer engineering teams like Mobile Foundation, Mobile Developer Experience, and Mobile Performance and Reliability, ensuring a reliable and performant toolkit across all layers of the stack.
Finally, you will also be expected to build and maintain relationships with other mobile engineers, both within our team, and across all of our customer teams to stay ahead of potential issues and understand upcoming needs. A key part of UI Systems’ job is to understand the current state of mobile development at Square, empathizing with the pain points of our customer teams, and work across platform teams to solve these issues – our team works with others to “get to yes” – we want to be an enabler, not a blocker.
Qualifications
You Have:
6+ years Android development experience with an emphasis on building complex, performant UI.
Jetpack Compose experience is highly beneficial, but not required if you have strong UI experience with the traditional Android View system.
Experience with, and understanding of UI design principles.
Experience building relationships across design and engineering.
Experience leading through influence across engineers.
We are a process-light team – you must have a strong bias towards action. We use processes to help us, not to constrain us.

"Senior Android Engineer, UI Systems",-1,-1,Afterpay,Remote,-1,-1,"Company Description
Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.
Job Description
UI Systems is building Square’s universal design system. This design system is deployed across all of Square’s seller-facing products on iOS, Android and web. This includes our flagship products Point of Sale, Square Register, and Square Terminal. Put simply, this team is building the public face of Square.
We’re not only building a design system, though: our mandate is wider than that. UI Systems is also building the core UI frameworks and tools needed to make building, testing, and maintaining UI easy and fast at scale: we’re supporting over 200 mobile engineers (and growing!) with our work across Android and iOS.
Why are we doing this? As Square grows, ensuring a consistent experience across many products becomes a larger and larger challenge. At Square, we value great and consistent design – UI Systems is here to ensure that Square’s customers and Square engineers alike have a delightful and consistent experience when working with, or working on our products – no matter who built them.
On iOS, our design system is built with Blueprint, our open source declarative UI framework. On Android, we’re building the design system from the ground up with Compose – this is Square’s first wide-scale deployment of Compose, and one of the first large-scale deployments of Compose anywhere outside of Google itself.
You Will:
As an engineer on the UI Systems team, you’ll be expected to partner closely with our design peers to inform and deliver components and tools that help our product engineers work faster, while ensuring a higher quality experience for Square’s sellers. You’ll also function as a translator of sorts – identifying needs and missing pieces from engineering and bringing them to the team to push the entire system forward. We also work closely with peer engineering teams like Mobile Foundation, Mobile Developer Experience, and Mobile Performance and Reliability, ensuring a reliable and performant toolkit across all layers of the stack.
Finally, you will also be expected to build and maintain relationships with other mobile engineers, both within our team, and across all of our customer teams to stay ahead of potential issues and understand upcoming needs. A key part of UI Systems’ job is to understand the current state of mobile development at Square, empathizing with the pain points of our customer teams, and work across platform teams to solve these issues – our team works with others to “get to yes” – we want to be an enabler, not a blocker.
Qualifications
You Have:
6+ years Android development experience with an emphasis on building complex, performant UI.
Jetpack Compose experience is highly beneficial, but not required if you have strong UI experience with the traditional Android View system.
Experience with, and understanding of UI design principles.
Experience building relationships across design and engineering.
Experience leading through influence across engineers.
We are a process-light team – you must have a strong bias towards action. We use processes to help us, not to constrain us.
